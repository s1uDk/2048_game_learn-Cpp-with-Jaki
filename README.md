2048 is a single-player puzzle game where the goal is to combine tiles with the same number by sliding them in four directions (up, down, left, or right) on a 4x4 grid. Each time a valid move is made, a new tile with the value of 2 appears. The game ends when no more valid moves are possible, and the objective is to reach the 2048 tile.
